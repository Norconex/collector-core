such as prometheus.

Also, make it so that some metrics could be serializable (data store)
or volatile.

Something like this:

// track serializable vs volatile
// log to stdout or not (just in crawl store or for internal use
// maybe allow a few basic types. E.g., "int.processed=02"

// Trackers could be :

base class is observable and has:

  String uniqueId;
  <T> value
  Class<T> type
  boolean volatile?
  LogLevel logLevel (off by default).

impl. specific methods, e.g.:

  increment()


Each above trackers would be stored in a Map, or an object wrapping a map:


Also have ability to register event listeners for those wanting to react
to trackers.
