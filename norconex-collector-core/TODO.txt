- Test/modify so that the crawler can be restarted in the same VM
  (e.g. for people wanting java scheduling).

- To remove number of dependencies and reduce maintenance, 
  deprecate and eventually remove:
   - MapDB given MVStore is a more stable and as fast equivalent.
   - Derby given H2 is a significantly faster equivalent.

- Refactor the whole approach of passing if new or modified to simplify it.

- Introduce full/incremental flag as part of collector framework

- Have document default value other than NEW (e.g. UNKNOWN, UNPROCESSED, etc) 

- Consider using Hibernate for the JDBC data store, for both embedded and
  client-server databases.  Ship with no drivers
  except maybe for testing (or 1 for convenience, like H2).

- Consider changing default base directory for logs and progress 
  (to avoid logs and progress appearing twice in path by default).
