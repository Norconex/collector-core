TODO:
==============

- Add ability to have multiple crawlers talk to the same crawl store
  for managing their queue (maybe MapReduce/Spark would be best?).

- Add support for event listeners at crawler level, which would only
  get events for that crawler (since events are bubbling up, not down/sideways).

- AbstractCrawlerConfig.xsd has the anyComplexRequiredClassType "class" being
  optional. See if we can make it required, except for self-closing tags.

- Rename RegexReferenceFilter here or the one in Importer module
  to avoid sharing same name.

- Extract out crawl store implementations to reduce dependencies 
  (only keep one). and potentially redesign as well.

- Make sure validation reporting works fine (ignore vs throw exception)

- Remove the need for XXXConfigLoader?

- Add parent pom for managed dependencies.

- Add workdir to collector, and by default, have log, progress share it.
  At crawler level, have all other paths relative to collector workdir,
  or crawler workdir if that one is specified.  

- Similar to above, maybe create a FileResource object and provide a way to 
  "register" it when classes need to write files, labeling them as "backup", 
  "delete", "keep" when crawler is done/starts.  And have that managed 
  automatically by crawler/collector.  Also have a flag on that object to 
  mention its scope, to say if it can be shared between threads, crawler,
  all or else (multiple collectors??).

- Add <regex> to RegexReferenceFilter to match how it is done
  in Importer.

- Rename RegexReferenceFilter to avoid confusion with class of the same name
  in Importer.

- Add a new flag to start crawling "fresh" (deleting the crawl database).

- In Allow crawler to "expire" after configurable delay if 
  activeCount in AbstractCrawler#processNextReference is equal or less
  than number of thread and the crawler has been running idle for too long.

- Consider adding metadata checksummer to AbstractCrawlerConfig
  given there are already metadata filters. Add Metadata checksum stage as well?

- Refactor the whole approach of passing if new or modified to simplify it.

- Introduce full/incremental flag as part of collector framework

- Have document default value other than NEW (e.g. UNKNOWN, UNPROCESSED, etc) 

- Consider using Hibernate for the JDBC data store, for both embedded and
  client-server databases.  Ship with no drivers
  except maybe for testing (or 1 for convenience, like H2).

- Consider changing default base directory for logs and progress 
  (to avoid logs and progress appearing twice in path by default).
  
- Consider a way to merge documents by temporarily storing mergeable
  docs in a queue until all mergable siblings are encountered.
  Maybe this should be made a wrapping committer instead?
